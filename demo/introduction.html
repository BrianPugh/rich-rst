The primary goal of reStructuredText is to define a markup syntax for use in Python docstrings and other documentation domains, that is readable and simple, yet powerful
intended purpose of the reStructuredText markup is twofold:

<span class="r3"> • </span>the establishment of a set of standard conventions allowing the
expression of structure within plaintext, and
<span class="r3"> • </span>the conversion of such documents into useful structured data
formats.

The secondary goal of reStructuredText is to be accepted by the Python community (by way of being blessed by PythonLabs and the BDFL ) as a standard for Python inline do

To clarify the primary goal, here are specific design goals, in order, beginning with the most important:

 1. Readable.  The marked-up text must be easy to read without any
prior knowledge of the markup language.  It should be as easily
read in raw form as in processed form.
 2. Unobtrusive.  The markup that is used should be as simple and
unobtrusive as possible.  The simplicity of markup constructs
should be roughly proportional to their frequency of use.  The most
common constructs, with natural and obvious markup, should be the
simplest and most unobtrusive.  Less common constructs, for which
there is no natural or obvious markup, should be distinctive.
 3. Unambiguous.  The rules for markup must not be open for
interpretation.  For any given input, there should be one and only
one possible output (including error output).
 4. Unsurprising.  Markup constructs should not cause unexpected output
upon processing.  As a fallback, there must be a way to prevent
unwanted markup processing when a markup construct is used in a
non-markup context (for example, when documenting the markup syntax
itself).
 5. Intuitive.  Markup should be as obvious and easily remembered as
possible, for the author as well as for the reader.  Constructs
should take their cues from such naturally occurring sources as
plaintext email messages, newsgroup postings, and text
documentation such as README.txt files.
 6. Easy.  It should be easy to mark up text using any ordinary text
editor.
 7. Scalable.  The markup should be applicable regardless of the length
of the text.
 8. Powerful.  The markup should provide enough constructs to produce a
reasonably rich structured document.
 9. Language-neutral.  The markup should apply to multiple natural (as
well as artificial) languages, not only English.
 10. Extensible.  The markup should provide a simple syntax and
interface for adding more complex general markup, and custom
markup.
 11. Output-format-neutral.  The markup will be appropriate for
processing to multiple output formats, and will not be biased
toward any particular format.

The design goals above were used as criteria for accepting or rejecting syntax, or selecting between alternatives.

It is emphatically <span class="r4">not</span> the goal of reStructuredText to define docstring semantics, such as docstring contents or docstring length. These issues are orthogonal to the mar
the scope of this specification.

Also, it is not the goal of reStructuredText to maintain compatibility with StructuredText or Setext.  reStructuredText shamelessly steals their great ideas and ignores

reStructuredText, the specification, is based on StructuredText and Setext.  StructuredText was developed by Jim Fulton of Zope Corporation (formerly Digital Creations) 

I discovered StructuredText in late 1999 while searching for a way to document the Python modules in one of my projects.  Version 1.1 of StructuredText was included in D
going on since the inception of the mailing list in 1996, and possibly predates it.

I decided to modify the original module with my own extensions and some suggested by the Doc-SIG members.  I soon realized that the module was not written with extension
in mind, so I embarked upon a general reworking, including adapting it to the &quot;re&quot; regular expression module (the original inspiration for the name of this project).  
Soon after I completed the modifications, I discovered that StructuredText.py was up to version 1.23 in the ZOPE distribution. Implementing the new syntax extensions 
from version 1.23 proved to be an exercise in frustration, as the complexity of the module had become overwhelming.

In 2000, development on StructuredTextNG (&quot;Next Generation&quot;) began at Zope Corporation (then Digital Creations).  It seems to have many improvements, but still suffers f

I decided that a complete rewrite was in order, and even started a reStructuredText SourceForge project (now inactive).  My motivations (the &quot;itches&quot; I aim to &quot;scratch&quot;)

<span class="r3"> • </span>I need a standard format for inline documentation of the programs I
write.  This inline documentation has to be convertible to other
useful formats, such as HTML.  I believe many others have the same
need.
<span class="r3"> • </span>I believe in the Setext/StructuredText idea and want to help
formalize the standard.  However, I feel the current specifications
and implementations have flaws that desperately need fixing.
<span class="r3"> • </span>reStructuredText could form part of the foundation for a
documentation extraction and processing system, greatly benefitting
Python.  But it is only a part, not the whole.  reStructuredText is
a markup language specification and a reference parser
implementation, but it does not aspire to be the entire system.  I
don&#x27;t want reStructuredText or a hypothetical Python documentation
processor to die stillborn because of over-ambition.
<span class="r3"> • </span>Most of all, I want to help ease the documentation chore, the bane
of many a programmer.

Unfortunately I was sidetracked and stopped working on this project. In November 2000 I made the time to enumerate the problems of StructuredText and possible solutions,
and complete the first draft of a specification.  This first draft was posted to the Doc-SIG in three parts:

<span class="r3"> • </span>A Plan for Structured Text
<span class="r3"> • </span>Problems With StructuredText
<span class="r3"> • </span>reStructuredText: Revised Structured Text Specification

In March 2001 a flurry of activity on the Doc-SIG spurred me to further revise and refine my specification, the result of which you are now reading.  An offshoot of the 
reStructuredText project has been the realization that a single markup scheme, no matter how well thought out, may not be enough.  In order to tame the endless debates 
on Doc-SIG, a flexible Docstring Processing System framework needed to be constructed.  This framework has become the more important of the two projects; reStructuredTex

The project web site and the first project release were rolled out in June 2001, including posting the second draft of the spec  and the first draft of PEPs 256, 257, an

In November 2001, the reStructuredText parser was nearing completion. Development of the parser continued with the addition of small convenience features, improvements 
to the syntax, the filling in of gaps, and bug fixes.  After a long holiday break, in early 2002 most development moved over to the other Docutils components, the 
&quot;Readers&quot;, &quot;Writers&quot;, and &quot;Transforms&quot;.  A &quot;standalone&quot; reader (processes standalone text file documents) was completed in February, and a basic HTML writer (producing 
HTML 4.01, using CSS-1) was completed in early March.

PEP 287, &quot;reStructuredText Standard Docstring Format&quot;, was created to formally propose reStructuredText as a standard format for Python docstrings, PEPs, and other files
was first posted to comp.lang.python and the Python-dev mailing list on 2002-04-02.

Version 0.4 of the reStructuredText and Docstring Processing System projects were released in April 2002.  The two projects were immediately merged, renamed to &quot;Docutils
